# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves transforming the current chat interface into a Kimi-style centered layout that better reflects the professional, scholarly nature of Keisha AI as a counter-racist chatbot. The current interface has background imagery from the previous AI girlfriend concept that needs to be completely removed and replaced with a clean, professional design using deep maroon, black, and forest green colors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user accessing Keisha AI, I want to see a clean, centered welcome interface similar to Kimi, so that I immediately understand this is a professional scholarly tool for counter-racist work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first accesses the chat interface with no messages THEN the system SHALL display a centered layout with "KEISHA" branding prominently above the input box
2. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL remove all background images and use a clean dark background
3. WHEN the user sees the initial state THEN the system SHALL present a single, centered input box for starting conversations
4. WHEN the branding is displayed THEN the system SHALL use elegant typography that conveys authority and professionalism

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to transform from the centered welcome state to a full chat interface when I start a conversation, so that I have maximum space for meaningful dialogue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends their first message THEN the system SHALL transition from centered layout to full-screen chat interface
2. WHEN the chat is active THEN the system SHALL expand the chat area to use the entire available space
3. WHEN messages are present THEN the system SHALL maintain the sidebar but prioritize the chat area
4. WHEN transitioning between states THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations that feel professional

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the color scheme to be subtle and professional using deep maroon, black, and forest green, so that the interface supports serious counter-racist scholarship without being visually jarring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN colors are applied THEN the system SHALL use rich black as the primary background color
2. WHEN interactive elements are styled THEN the system SHALL use deep maroon for primary actions and highlights
3. WHEN success states or positive feedback are shown THEN the system SHALL use forest green appropriately
4. WHEN the overall design is viewed THEN the system SHALL appear subtle, professional, and non-jarring to users
5. WHEN text is displayed THEN the system SHALL use light grays that provide excellent readability on dark backgrounds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to completely remove any traces of the previous AI girlfriend concept, so that Keisha AI is clearly positioned as a serious counter-racist scholar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL display no background images related to the previous concept
2. WHEN styling is applied THEN the system SHALL use colors and design elements that convey scholarly authority
3. WHEN branding is shown THEN the system SHALL emphasize Keisha as a counter-racist scholar, not an AI companion
4. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL maintain a professional, academic tone throughout

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want optional suggestion chips or example prompts in the welcome state, so that I understand how to effectively engage with Keisha AI's counter-racist expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the welcome state is displayed THEN the system SHALL optionally show example prompts below the input box
2. WHEN suggestion chips are shown THEN the system SHALL display relevant counter-racist topics or questions
3. WHEN a user clicks a suggestion THEN the system SHALL populate the input box with that prompt
4. WHEN suggestions are styled THEN the system SHALL use the established color palette consistently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidebar to be minimal and unobtrusive in the welcome state but functional in the chat state, so that the interface feels clean initially but provides necessary navigation when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the welcome state is active THEN the system SHALL show a minimal, possibly collapsed sidebar
2. WHEN the chat state is active THEN the system SHALL ensure the sidebar remains accessible for navigation
3. WHEN the sidebar is displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with the new color scheme
4. WHEN transitioning between states THEN the system SHALL maintain sidebar functionality without disrupting the user experience
