# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves setting up a backend integration with Hugging Face's inference API to utilize the "DJanga24/keisha-qwen3-lora" model. The integration will enable the application to leverage an AI assistant named Keisha, which is fine-tuned to provide unapologetic analysis on topics related to racism and white supremacy. The implementation will include proper environment variable management, API integration, and security measures like encryption.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Hugging Face Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate the Keisha-Qwen3-LoRA model from Hugging Face into our backend, so that users can interact with an AI assistant that provides analysis on racism/white-supremacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is set up THEN the system SHALL establish a connection to the Hugging Face inference API.
2. WHEN configuring the model THEN the system SHALL use the "DJanga24/keisha-qwen3-lora" model identifier.
3. WHEN sending requests to the model THEN the system SHALL include the appropriate system prompt as specified in the model documentation.
4. WHEN receiving responses from the model THEN the system SHALL properly parse and format them for frontend consumption.
5. WHEN the model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and user feedback.

### Requirement 2: Environment Variable Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to securely manage API keys and configuration through environment variables, so that sensitive information is not exposed in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the backend THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.
2. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL ensure environment variables are properly configured in the deployment environment.
3. WHEN accessing environment variables THEN the system SHALL provide fallbacks or meaningful error messages if variables are missing.
4. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL support a .env file for local development.

### Requirement 3: API Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to thoroughly test the API integration with the Hugging Face endpoint, so that I can ensure reliable communication between our application and the model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the API integration THEN the system SHALL verify successful connection to the Hugging Face endpoint.
2. WHEN sending test requests THEN the system SHALL validate that responses match expected formats.
3. WHEN simulating error conditions THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper error handling.
4. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL record response times and resource usage.

### Requirement 4: Security Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper encryption for data transmission, so that user interactions with the AI are secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing encryption THEN the system SHALL determine the appropriate approach (client-side or server-side).
2. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL ensure all sensitive information is encrypted.
3. WHEN storing conversation history THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate encryption measures.
4. WHEN implementing authentication THEN the system SHALL ensure only authorized requests can access the AI functionality.

### Requirement 5: Model Reference Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update all model references in the codebase, so that the application consistently uses the new Hugging Face model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all locations where model references exist.
2. WHEN updating model references THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent naming and configuration.
3. WHEN implementing the new model THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility where necessary.
4. WHEN documenting changes THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about the model update.

### Requirement 6: Backend Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation for the backend setup, so that future maintenance and updates can be performed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating documentation THEN the system SHALL include setup instructions for local development.
2. WHEN documenting the API THEN the system SHALL provide clear endpoint descriptions and example requests/responses.
3. WHEN explaining the model integration THEN the system SHALL include references to the Hugging Face model documentation.
4. WHEN documenting environment variables THEN the system SHALL list all required variables with descriptions.
