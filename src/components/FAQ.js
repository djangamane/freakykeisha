      question: "What makes Keisha AI the best choice for AI bias detection?",
      answer: "Keisha AI is built on years of research into counter-racist methodology and Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's frameworks.

    {
      question: "What is the Fragile News Decoder and how does it work?",
      answer: "The Fragile News Decoder is our specialized AI tool that exposes white fragility patterns in mainstream media. It identifies 'fragile news' - reporting that appears neutral but systematically protects white supremacist narratives through coded language and strategic omissions. The tool translates this coded language and reveals the true agenda behind seemingly objective reporting."
    },
    {
      question: "How is Keisha AI different from other AI bias detection tools?",

Keisha AI explicitly uses counter-racism frameworks as our core analytical lens. We don't just detect bias - we provide the fiery, assertive analysis needed to understand and combat systemic racism in AI systems."
    },
